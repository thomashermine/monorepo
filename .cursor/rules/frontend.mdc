This rule provides standards for frontend components:

When working in components directory:

-   Always use Tailwind for styling
-   Separate components into : primitives, blocks, composites
-   Each component in a dedicated subdirectory (primitives/MyComponent), with code in index.tsx and dedicated storybook stories in index.stories.tsx
