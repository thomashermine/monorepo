  Hello Thomas,
  
  First of all, big compliments on your beautiful house and interior design, we absolutely love it!
  
  We’re looking to get away for a few days after Christmas and, as big fans of the Ardennes, we came across your place. As
  much as we’d love to stay, our budget doesn’t quite match the current Airbnb rate of €1,739 for three nights.
  
  Would you be open to adjusting the rate for that period?
  
  Looking forward to your (hopefully positive) reply!
  
  Warm regards,
  
  Evert and Loes

  Hi Thomas, we just booked your cottage for 23 October, we are really looking forward to this! We want to go hiking in
  the area for 2 or 3 days and be able to eat out somewhere in the evening. Do you have nice/good tips for us where we can
  find hiking trails and tips for restaurants in the area? Kind regards, Frank and Marina

[GUEST] (2025-10-07T19:23:39.000Z)
  Hi, have you seen the above? Don't want to be rude but I'm curious! Have a nice evening! Kind regards, Frank

[HOST] (2025-10-07T19:48:46.000Z)
  Hi Frank ! Sorry for the late reply, it has been some crazy day at work 😊 
  We very much look forward to welcoming you at The View! 
  
  For dinner, we can highly recommend Linea, in Spa, for beautiful italian food (our favorite) !
  https://www.linea.restaurant/ - Wwe suggest making a reservation in advance).
  
  In Spa, you can also have some nice fondue and raclette at Le Chalet Suisse https://www.chaletsuisse.be/. - reservation
  in advance too).
  
  While in Spa, it’s definitely worth taking some time to walk around this beautiful little town, and if you enjoy
  pastries, Chez Blanche is an absolute must. Another easy and nice option is Les Doux Ragots in La Gleize, where you can
  enjoy fries and a burger (or a boulet à la liégeoise) in a cozy chalet atmosphere. There are also a few pizzerias in
  Coo, easy for a more casual dinner. And for something easy and practical, you will also find a prepared-meal distributor
  next to the BPost in Stoumont.
  
  As for trails, I can very much recommend installing the iOS/Android app "AllTrails", it's very complete. We have a few
  trails starting from the lodge, and we are quite near the very popular and famous "Ninglinspo" as well 😊 
  
  We hope you’ll enjoy your stay ! Don't hesitate if you have any other question ! :)

[GUEST] (2025-10-07T19:51:24.000Z)
  Hi Thomas, thank you for the message!! We will look into it! 🙏👌

[GUEST] (2025-10-10T17:29:15.000Z)
  Hi Thomas, another question we love sushi very much but are not necessarily people who are looking for very expensive
  and exclusive, do you have another tip for where we might go? Grt Frank and Marina

[HOST] (2025-10-10T17:40:28.000Z)
  Hi Frank, in takeaway I can very much recommend “Yuuki” 😊

  Hi, we are really looking forward to it! We have just taken a beautiful walk at Nadrin and are now eating something in
  La Roche and Ardenne. I expect we'll be there in about 1.5 hours. Regards, Frank and Marina

[GUEST] (2025-10-23T14:53:49.000Z)
  We have arrived and it is beautiful!! We just wanted to raise the temperature a little, but we can't find that directly
  on the tablet, which menu should we look in?

[HOST] (2025-10-23T15:03:50.000Z)
  Hello Frank! Glad you liked it ☺️ Sorry that the lodge was not warm enough to your liking, I’ve just raised the
  temperature from 20 to 22 for you 😊 Just tell me if you want it raised more or lowered down later on 😊 It’s floor
  heating so it might take a while for the change to reflect. Have a wonderful evening and don’t hesitate if you have any
  other questions ! ☺️ 🌳🌳 Thomas et Caroline

[GUEST] (2025-10-23T15:05:59.000Z)
  Ok totally super and no sorry it's beautiful!! We saw that even the hot tub is already on, fantastic!! 😀😀

  Good evening, we just arrived, super nice house!

[GUEST] (2025-10-19T16:45:02.000Z)
  We would like to eat something in the area (something simple), is there anything nearby that you know of?

[HOST] (2025-10-19T16:45:58.000Z)
  Glad to read that ! ☺️☺️
  Yes for a quick bite we can very much recommend “Les Doux Ragots”
  It’s a very nice small brasserie 😊

[GUEST] (2025-10-19T17:40:47.000Z)
  Quick question, is there also a lighter to light the candles?

[HOST] (2025-10-19T17:43:14.000Z)
  You should find one in the inner drawer of the top drawer in the kitchen 😊

[GUEST] (2025-10-19T17:44:11.000Z)
  Should that be here?

[HOST] (2025-10-19T17:47:21.000Z)
  Yes ! Maybe in small wooden cupboard ? If not, last guests must have left with it :-(

[GUEST] (2025-10-19T17:48:14.000Z)
  No, there's nothing there either, unfortunately

[GUEST] (2025-10-19T18:06:18.000Z)
  Another question, can you also link Spotify to the audio system and when I turn on the romantic lighting everything goes
  off. Do I have to do something or am I doing something wrong?

[HOST] (2025-10-19T18:07:13.000Z)
  We’ll drop a new lighter tomorrow ☺️

[HOST] (2025-10-19T18:08:08.000Z)
  For Spotify, once you join our WiFi, you should be able to pick the sound system as output directly in Spotify 😊

[GUEST] (2025-10-20T14:42:14.000Z)
  Hey! Quick question I can't find it that fast, do we have to do anything before we can get into the hot tub?

[GUEST] (2025-10-20T14:42:23.000Z)
  And thank you for the lighters!!

[HOST] (2025-10-20T14:49:36.000Z)
  Hi Michael,
  
  Nothing special: a small shower (outside, it's nice) before is recommended, remove the cover (00) and enjoy! 😊

[GUEST] (2025-10-22T15:34:26.000Z)
  Good afternoon, question. We have been in the hot tub twice, we wanted to get back in now only it is now cloudy (bottom
  almost not visible, I looked in the grey chlorine dispenser and there is a very small amount in it.
  Can we solve this ourselves? 
  Please let me know!
  Michael

[HOST] (2025-10-22T15:50:21.000Z)
  Hi Michaël!
  
  I think it’s indeed a chlorine issue, as the filtration system works every day. There is a chlorine reserve in the gray
  box next to the Nordic bath. You can add more (be careful, it’s quite an agressive smell when you open the box 😁).
  
  We will check with the cleaning team if they refilled it correctly, as you shouldn’t have nearly ran out 😊 
  
  Have a wonderful evening and don’t hesitate if you have any other question 😊

[GUEST] (2025-10-22T15:54:25.000Z)
  I added 1 tablet, this is what was left in it.

[HOST] (2025-10-22T15:55:23.000Z)
  Perfect 😊 That will do! Thanks a ton ☺️

[GUEST] (2025-10-23T06:59:53.000Z)
  Good morning, do we have anything else to do before check-out? Waste collection or something?

[HOST] (2025-10-23T07:04:24.000Z)
  Hello Michaël,
  
  No need, we will take care of the trash for you. 
  
  Just enjoy your morning. :)

[GUEST] (2025-10-23T09:13:00.000Z)
  Oops, I was just about to sweep the deck before showering and then the broomstick broke. Sorry!

  Dear Thomas,
  We received a booking confirmation for the holiday home some time ago. According to the information provided, we should
  have received a payment link at least two weeks before our stay. Unfortunately, we have not received it to date.
  I already sent an email regarding this matter on Wednesday but have not received a response yet.
  Therefore, I kindly ask you once again to send us the payment link so we can complete the payment on time.
  Could you also please confirm whether our booking is still valid?
  We would appreciate a short reply.
  Kind regards,
  Katja and Nico

  Good afternoon,
  
  Today we will arrive at the Airbnb. I'd love to hear how to access the Airbnb. 
  
  Kind regards,
  Camilo

  Hello again Camilo!,
  
  We won’t be able to welcome you in person around 16:00, but don’t worry self checkin is super easy 😊 
  
  Your personal code for the numpad next to the door is : 295281. And the code for the Nordic bath is 0000.
  
  Everything else is explained on a short guide on the coffee table 😊 
  
  If you have any other questions, we’ll be just a message away 😊 
  
  Have a safe trip !
  
  🌳🌳 Thomas et Caroline

[GUEST] (2025-10-13T13:36:01.000Z)
  Hello, 
  
  Thank you for the great explanation! We are looking forward to it! 
  
  Kind regards,
  Camilo

[GUEST] (2025-10-13T20:32:03.000Z)
  Hi Thomas, sorry for the late message. Just used the lovely hot tub, it was already warm when we were there. 
  
  However, when we were in it for 5 minutes, the massage jets started to blow. Not all the bubbles went on, just the
  sides. We can't get these out now, could you help us with this? Thank you in advance!

[HOST] (2025-10-13T20:35:01.000Z)
  Hi Camilo! 😊 
  Don’t worry at all about the late message 😌
  
  The hot tub automatically circulates water when it gets below a certain temperature, to warm it up again. It will
  automatically stop doing that as soon as it’s at the proper temperature 😊 
  
  You can simply close the cover when you’re done using it, even if the jets still do their thing 😊 
  
  Have a nice evening and don’t hesitate if you have any other question 😌

[GUEST] (2025-10-13T20:36:47.000Z)
  Thanks for the quick response! Good to hear. Thank you for the clarification. 
  
  Have a nice evening too 😁

  Bonjour, vous me confirmez, qu'il s'agit d'un chalet, avec bain à remous, sauna privé dans chambre, et terrasse avec vue
  privé? 
  Bien à vous

  Bonjour Julien !

[HOST] (2025-09-04T12:53:22.000Z)
  Bonjour Julien ! Tout à fait 😊 A l'extérieur, ce n'est pas un bain à remous mais un bain nordique, soit un cuve
  recouverte de bois et chauffée à 40° environ 😊 Vous verrez pour l'instant sur notre fiche les photos d'un bain à remous
  gonflable extérieur INTEX, mais celui-ci va être remplacé fin septembre par la bain nordique, qui sera donc disponible
  pour votre séjour 😊 Il y a également un bain à remous intérieur, un sauna, et une terrasse. Le logement est 100%
  privatif 😊

[GUEST] (2025-09-04T12:58:56.000Z)
  Merci beaucoup pour vos précisions.
  Rdv fin octobre.
  je reviendrai vers vous pour le petit-déjeuner. 
  
  A bientôt.

  qu’il est installé 😊 
  
  D’ici là, que tout se passe au mieux pour vous Julien 😌

[GUEST] (2025-10-06T15:26:34.000Z)
  Dear Thomas and Caroline,
  
  We are looking forward to our arrival in the Ardennes.
  
  I was wondering if you have some recommendations for a nice place to have dinner for two people close to the house?

[HOST] (2025-10-07T14:23:20.000Z)
  Hello Bram ! 
  
  Thank you for your message ! We are very happy to welcome you soon in the Ardennes ! :) 
  
  For dinner, we can highly recommend Linea, in Spa, for beautiful italian food (our favorite) !
  https://www.linea.restaurant/ - Wwe suggest making a reservation in advance).
  
  In Spa, you can also have some nice fondue and raclette at Le Chalet Suisse https://www.chaletsuisse.be/. - reservation
  in advance too).
  
  While in Spa, it’s definitely worth taking some time to walk around this beautiful little town, and if you enjoy
  pastries, Chez Blanche is an absolute must.
  
  Another easy and nice option is Les Doux Ragots in La Gleize, where you can enjoy fries and a burger (or a boulet à la
  liégeoise) in a cozy chalet atmosphere. There are also a few pizzerias in Coo, easy for a more casual dinner.
  
  And for something easy and practical, you will also find a prepared-meal distributor next to the BPost in Stoumont.
  
  We hope you’ll enjoy your stay ! Don't hesitate if you have any other question ! :)
  
  Caroline & Thomas 🌿

  Hi Bram,
  
  I came by and had a look at the vanity — it’s very weird because the support board has snapped very cleanly on both
  sides and there’s no trace of humidity or wear.
  
  In any case, I’ll handle the repair myself so no big deal... I can come in and repair it tomorrow anytime starting at
  11, it should take about 1 hour at max. Just tell me what time suits you best. Or we can leave it like that till your
  checkout if you prefer. 
  
  Have a nice evening,
  
  🌳🌳
  Thomas & Caroline

[GUEST] (2025-10-10T17:19:07.000Z)
  Dear Thomas, thanks for your quick response! It is great that you can repair it yourself. We will let you know about our
  plans for tomorrow later this evening after we get back from dinner

[GUEST] (2025-10-10T18:04:27.000Z)
  We will leave the lodge around 12:00. Is that okay for you?

[HOST] (2025-10-10T19:19:31.000Z)
  Perfect ! I’ll be there around that time 😊 Have a good evening

[HOST] (2025-10-11T13:11:11.000Z)
  Hello Bram,
  Everything is back in order ! As the glue is still fresh please be very gentle with the vanity, and especially do not
  lean on it.
  Enjoy the rest of your stay!

[GUEST] (2025-10-11T13:39:27.000Z)
  Hello Thomas, it looks very good! Well done. We will be very gentle. 
  
  Thanks!

  Hi Caroline and Thomas,
  We are very much looking forward to our trip to Stoumont today! Since we are arriving by car from Germany, we cannot yet
  say exactly when we will be there. However, we plan to arrive between 4:00 pm and 5:00 pm. 
  The documents say that you can enter the house via a keypad. What's the password? 
  Best regards and have a nice Sunday! :)

[HOST] (2025-10-05T08:45:32.000Z)
  Hello Séverin,
  
  Thank you for your message — we’re delighted to welcome you today! 😌
  
  You can access The View via the keypad at the entrance using the code 295281.
  
  Take your time on the road and enjoy the drive through the Ardennes — everything will be ready for you when you arrive.
  ☺️

[GUEST] (2025-10-05T14:46:06.000Z)
  Hey Thomas & Caroline, 
  
  We arrived well and already feel very comfortable!! The house is fantastic. 
  
  When we arrived, another car parked at the house and they have now left. Unfortunately, it was difficult to get to the
  house by car because it is very slippery. Is there another place to park the car if we don't get to the house in the
  next few days in bad weather? 
  
  Best, 
  Severin & Nele

[HOST] (2025-10-05T14:53:36.000Z)
  Hi Severin & Nele,
  
  Thanks for your message — we’re really happy to hear you arrived well and are enjoying the house! 😌
  
  Yes, if the path is too slippery, you can park a bit lower down the street, along the stairs that lead to the garden.
  It’s a safe and convenient spot.
  
  🌳🌳 Thomas & Caroline

[GUEST] (2025-10-08T10:40:09.000Z)
  Hey Thomas & Caroline, 
  
  We feel very comfortable in The View! It's so cozy and beautiful here 😍
  We wanted to let you know before we left that two of the candles have burned out. Maybe you want to provide new ones
  before the next guests arrive. 
  
  Best wishes

  Hello Séverin & Nele,
  
  That's lovely, thank you so much  for your message. We'll put some more in! :) 
  
  Enjoy the place! 🌱 
  
  Caroline and Thomas

[GUEST] (2025-10-10T08:40:35.000Z)
  Hello Caroline and Thomas,
  We are now on our way home. We really liked our stay at The View! A really nice house. Thank you for your quick answers.
  
  We weren't sure where to put the rubbish, so we left it in the containers. Only the organic waste is tied up in the
  sink. We hope that's okay. 
  
  When we opened the whirlpool outside, we encountered a fire salamander. Since we didn't know what to do with it, we left
  it in the pool and closed it. I am also sending a photo of it. We hope that's okay. Since the animals are slightly
  poisonous, we did not know exactly what to do. 
  
  Best regards and thank you!

  Hi Kristel! I'm sorry to come with bad news but indeed, we handle booking requests in the order they were made, and
  someone had made a request just hours before yours. We’re really sorry about that — sometimes dates get taken very
  quickly. Hopefully we’ll have the chance to welcome you another time — 🌳🌳 Thomas et Caroline

  Ah how unfortunate! But thank you for your respons.

  Hello Ina! 
  I’m terribly sorry for the late reply, it seems your email was marked as spam wrongfully by our system. You’ll receive a
  link for payment 14 days prior to your arrival, when cancellation is no longer possible 😌 If you prefer, it’s also
  possible to pay at the property, as we try to welcome our guest in person as often as possible 😌
  
  We look very much forward welcoming you at The View!
  
  All the best till then,

  Dear,
  
  We are interested in staying here for 2 nights with our newborn baby if a price reduction would be possible.
  
  Could anything be done about the price, please?
  
  Thank you in advance!
  
  Best,

[HOST] (2025-09-25T08:12:28.000Z)
  Hi Senne ! 
  
  Thank you so much for reaching out — and warm congratulations on your little one 👶💛
  
  Our prices are already the best possible given all the private wellness amenities we include (sauna, jacuzzi, smart
  features ✨). 
  
  That said, we sometimes release last-minute offers for the very next day or two, so it’s always worth checking the
  evening before your preferred dates 😌
  
  We’re also excited to let you know that we’ve just added a beautiful Nordic bath and a brand-new terrace 🌲 — perfect
  for unwinding while enjoying the stunning view. New photos will be online next week, but they already make the cabin
  feel even more special.
  
  We’d be truly delighted to welcome you and your family for a peaceful and relaxing stay 🌿
  With warm regards,
  🌳🌳 Thomas et Caroline

  Fantastic! I just need to reconcile the dates at work tomorrow and then I can complete the booking. If possible, we
  would like to use a cot! Very nice! 😊

[HOST] (2025-08-03T13:30:32.000Z)
  Perfect, looking forward to welcome you and noted for the cot 😊

  Hello Eline,
  I hope you are doing great 😌 
  
  I’m reaching out to let you know that the power company just informed us that the electric network will be shut down for
  4 hours during your stay : from 8:30 till 12:30 on the 17/09. 
  We will leave a small battery inside the lodge during you stay to reduce the inconvenience, and you should also have hot
  water still during that period 😊 
  
  We look very much forward to welcoming you 😌 All the best till then !
  
  🌳🌳 Thomas et Caroline

[GUEST] (2025-09-09T12:13:54.000Z)
  Hi Thomas! 
  
  Good to know! Thanks for letting us know. I would like to remind you of my request for the cot. Are a sheet and blankets
  also available for this? 
  
  We look forward to our stay!
  
  Best,
  Eline

[HOST] (2025-09-10T10:46:14.000Z)
  Hello Eline, 
  
  Thank you for your message. We confirm that a baby travel bed will be available during your stay, as well as a sheet for
  the mattress and a small light blanket for the baby. :)
  
  Please let me know if you have any questions! :) 
  
  See you soon! 
  
  Caroline

[GUEST] (2025-09-12T08:17:28.000Z)
  Super nice! Thanks Caroline!

[GUEST] (2025-09-15T06:36:35.000Z)
  Hi Caroline,
  
  I have one more question before departure. Are there towels in the cabin? 
  
  We look forward to it!
  
  Regards, 
  Eline

[HOST] (2025-09-15T06:45:40.000Z)
  Hello Eline,
  
  Off course! 😊 We provide towels, bed sheets and even bath robes. Everything you might need we'll be there 😌
  
  Looking forward welcoming you! 😌

  Hello Eline !
  
  Here we finally are : it’s time for checkin 🌼☺️
  
  You’ll find a numpad on the right hand side of the door. The code is : 295181.
  
  The cot has been setup already ☺️
  
  We are just a few minutes away if you need anything 😌
  
  
  We wish you a very pleasant stay ! 
  
  🌳🌳 Thomas et Caroline

[GUEST] (2025-09-15T18:50:51.000Z)
  Hi Thomas and Caroline,
  
  Thank you in advance for everything! Very nice that the cot was already ready. It's beautiful here!
  
  If you have any good tips on what to do nearby, nice walks or a good restaurant, we are definitely open to that!
  
  Best,
  Eline

[HOST] (2025-09-16T06:52:49.000Z)
  Hi Eline,
  
  Off course we have a few tips 😌
  
  For restaurant, we can highly recommend “Les Doux Ragots” in La Gleize, as well as Linea in Spa (a reservation is needed
  for this one). While you are there, Spa is a beautiful little town definitely worth to explore 😊 And you can pick up
  some very good pastries at “Chez Blanche” 😌
  
  In terms of walks, if you leave the cabin straight up after our parking spot, you’ll find a view point about 10min walk
  from there. And there is a ton of great trails nearby ⏤ the easiest option is to download the app “All Trails” 😊

[HOST] (2025-09-16T07:07:13.000Z)
  And here are a few more suggestions for walks and activities to do around the Lodge: 
  
  Nearby (by car):
  Ninglinspo walk – one of the most beautiful walks in the Ardennes, along a wild stream.
  Vecquée Walk – ideal for immersion in the forest.
  Tour of Lake Coo – pleasant and accessible, with the waterfall as a bonus.
  
  About 20 minutes away:
  Stavelot Abbey – several museums (including one on the Spa-Francorchamps circuit) and interesting temporary exhibitions.
  In Spa:
  The famous thermal baths for a moment of relaxation.
  Small local shops and good restaurants to stroll around and eat well.
  
  Right now, it's deer rut season – a unique experience!
  To listen to it, go to the side of La Gleize, near the recycling centre, at the intersection of Rue La Vaulx-Renard and
  Froidcour. Park along the road, then enter the woods: there are often people, but the show is worth it.
  
  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask!
  
  Caroline & Thomas 🌳🌳

[GUEST] (2025-09-16T09:46:33.000Z)
  Thanks for all the tips! 😊

[GUEST] (2025-09-17T07:36:07.000Z)
  Good morning! 
  
  We currently have no power. Where can we find the small battery left in the lodge? 
  
  Best,
  Eline

[HOST] (2025-09-17T08:01:25.000Z)
  Hey Eline,

[HOST] (2025-09-17T08:03:33.000Z)
  Good morning Eline ! 
  
  I have bad news 😔I had ordered the battery especially for today, but the delivery has been severely delayed and it
  hasn’t arrived yet. If the postman still manages to drop it off today, I’ll come by right away to bring it to you.
  The power should be back by 12:30, but please let me know if you need anything in the meantime ! Sorry again about that…
  Wishing you a lovely day none the less! 
  
  🌳🌳 Thomas et Caroline

[GUEST] (2025-09-17T08:30:13.000Z)
  Hi Thomas,
  
  No problem! We'll manage without power for the next two hours and will be out in a minute.  
  
  Have a nice day!

[HOST] (2025-09-19T09:33:47.000Z)
  Hi Éline 🌿
  I hope you’re having a wonderful time at The View ✨
  Would it be okay if a carpenter stopped by today between 4 and 6 PM, just to take a few quick measurements around the
  outdoor hot tub ?
  It won’t take more than 15 minutes, and he won’t need to come inside 🙏
  
  Of course, no worries at all if the timing isn’t convenient for you — just let me know ☺️
  
  Have a wonderful day,
  
  🌳🌳 Thomas et Caroline

[GUEST] (2025-09-21T08:29:35.000Z)
  Hi Thomas,
  
  Sorry for my late reply! I hadn't seen your message. We were not at the cabin at that time so hopefully it worked out! 
  
  Then I have another question. Since the power outage, a number of lights cannot be operated, the sound system does not
  work and the sauna can no longer be turned on. Now I would like to use the sauna today. Can that still be repaired?
  
  I'd love to hear from you! ☺️
  
  Best,
  Eline

[HOST] (2025-09-21T09:02:11.000Z)
  Hello Éline !
  
  Oh no, thanks for telling me ! I think I was able to fix everything remotely 😊
  I took the liberty to turn on the sauna as well ☺️
  Could you confirm everything is in order ?
  
  Have a wonderful day,

  Hi Thomas, the spa gives error E90, do you know how to fix this?

[HOST] (2025-08-29T12:20:47.000Z)
  Hi Gerlof,
  
  No worries, the filter needs to be changed.:) 
  
  There are some in the small trunk next to the hot tub. 
  
  To change the hot tub filter, just turn off the pump, unscrew the filter housing cover, remove the worn cartridge,
  insert the new cartridge, then screw the lid back on before turning on the pump. Buttons: Enter then flame and filter. 
  
  If there's a problem, I can come. I'm ten minutes away.:)

[GUEST] (2025-08-29T12:24:07.000Z)

[GUEST] (2025-08-30T09:00:45.000Z)
  Hello, we are leaving now.  Thank you for the nice days. You have a beautiful cottage with an even more beautiful view!
  The dirty laundry is in the bath, some of the rubbish is already by the door and there are still some dirty dishes in
  the dishwasher. 1 of the bathrobes had no belt. This was already the case. The curtain at the sliding door is black in a
  few places. We didn't do this either and it was already like that. We just wanted to point that out. Have a nice day!

[GUEST] (2025-08-30T09:01:18.000Z)
  There is still 1 egg and a jar of mayonnaise in the fridge. You can use them or throw them away.

[HOST] (2025-08-30T17:47:23.000Z)
  Hello,
  Thank you so much for your kind words — we’re delighted you enjoyed your stay and the views!
  
  Thanks also for pointing out the little details about the bathrobe and curtain, that’s very helpful. 
  No worries at all about the laundry, garbage or dishes, we took care of everything.
  Safe travels home and we’d be happy to welcome you back anytime!

  Hi, would it be possible for us to receive the door code? I’m currently looking for a new car and on our way we are
  stopping at a few garages to have a look. This is taking a bit longer than expected, so we plan to have dinner on the
  way and will only arrive after 6:30 p.m. I’d appreciate it if you could let me know if this is possible.

  Wow, what a beautiful place! We could really enjoy ourselves here for a few days. One more question: is it possible to
  play music on the speakers? I can’t seem to find any instructions for them.

  Supe glad you enjoy the place Loraine ☺️☺️
  
  Once connected to the WiFi (Using the QR code or password shown on the guide on the coffee table), you’ll be able to
  select the speakers in Spotify, YouTube Music or any app compatible with Google Cast 😊

  Dear Thomas,
  
  my name is Joana and I'm looking for an accomodation for my sister and her boyfriend for a little getaway. My sister has
  ME/CFS and is highly restricted in her mobility and can't really go out or do any activities. That's why I'm looking for
  vacation houses that have a garden and a pool and stumbled across your house! :) In the description it says there is an
  outdoor whirlpool included, is that right? I haven't seen any photos, that's why I'm asking. 
  
  All the best
  Joana

[HOST] (2025-07-23T15:09:29.000Z)
  Hello Joana,
  
  We would be thrilled to welcome your sister and her boyfriend !
  
  We do have an outdoor jacuzzi, I’m sending a few pictures of the spot 😊 
  
  Would it be possible for your sister despite her medical condition to climb a few steps ? There is a few to reach the
  lodge, as pictured too. Otherwise it’s also possible for her to get inside from the bedroom door, as long as someone
  opens for her 😊

[HOST] (2025-07-23T15:10:22.000Z)
  Ok, so apparently I can’t send you picture just yet, but I was planning to update the listing anyway so I will do that
  instead and poke you once it’s done 😌

[GUEST] (2025-07-23T15:14:16.000Z)
  Hi Thomas, 
  
  thank you so much for your quick reply and your help, esp. with the pictures. That is so helpful for her, as it's always
  a bit difficult to assess what works for her! :) 
  
  I'm sending my sister all the information and get back to you asap. Thank you! 😊

[HOST] (2025-07-23T15:17:19.000Z)
  My pleasure 😌😌
  If she needs any more information, please just ask me ☺️ Have a nice afternoon!

[GUEST] (2025-07-23T16:30:46.000Z)
  Hi Thomas, I just booked your lodge for my sister and her boyfriend! They are both very much looking forward. :) Thank
  you so much again for your support!

[HOST] (2025-07-23T16:32:58.000Z)

  Hello Thomas! We look forward to staying in your home :)
  Until then,

[GUEST] (2025-08-14T10:44:39.000Z)
  Hello Thomas, 
  We are looking forward to our stay. We are expected to arrive in Targnon tomorrow at 2:30 pm. Would it be possible to
  stay in the garden/outdoor area of the lodge? And is there a swimming facility nearby? So a swimming spot on a river or
  lake? We'd love a recommendation :) 
  Thank you in advance and best regards 
  Gina

[HOST] (2025-08-14T11:05:42.000Z)
  Hi Gina,
  
  We look very much forward welcoming you tomorrow ☺️
  The lodge will be cleaned at that time, but are more than welcomed to chill on the terrace, I’ve warned Isabelle, the
  person that take cleaning in charge that you’ll be there 😊 
  
  As for swimming spots, the river is just down the street, about a 10min walk. But if you want an official, safe place
  you can find one here : https://visitwallonia.com/en-gb/3/i-love/wallonia-land-of-water/where-to-go-wild-swimming
  
  Have a beautiful day ☺️
  
  See you tomorrow!
  
  🌳🌳 Thomas & Caroline

[GUEST] (2025-08-14T14:46:06.000Z)
  Hi Thomas, thank you so much for letting us stay on the terrace and for letting Isabelle know.
  Great that the river is so close. Unfortunately, I'm not so good on foot, do you know a place where you can get close to
  the water by car? 
  Thanks and best regards 
  Gina

[HOST] (2025-08-14T14:59:32.000Z)
  Hello again Gina 😌
  The spot I was thinking of is also reachable by car, see here : https://maps.app.goo.gl/E5yRLM1pjMiVZw8j6?g_st=ipc
  
  But I’m not a big swimmer myself so I can’t be telling you for sure you’ll be able to swim there. Best and safest option
  would be to pick one of the official spot recommended by VisitWallonia 😊

  Would that work ?

[GUEST] (2025-08-11T12:04:41.000Z)
  Good afternoon. The pool shows an E90 error. We have changed the filter, but the pump does not work it seems

[HOST] (2025-08-11T12:08:10.000Z)
  Hi Tim,
  
  Perfect, that's the code for the filter. :) 
  
  Can you turn off the jacuzzi (you can unplug it and then plug it back in and press the on button on the black control)?
  Then press "enter" and then the flame and filter. 
  
  Tell me if it works, otherwise I'll come and fix it. 
  
  I'll put instructions for the next time. :) 
  
  Caroline

[GUEST] (2025-08-11T12:27:28.000Z)
  I think it works 👌🏻

  Bonsoir Caroline, unfortunately we have to check out tomorrow, we would’ve loved to stay longer. 
  Will you be there for checkout or do we just lock the door? We will be out at 12:00

[HOST] (2025-08-12T17:44:08.000Z)
  Good evening Tim,
  
  Oh, you're welcome whenever you want☺️! Did everything go well with the lovely Abby then? 
  
  I'll try to come by at noon, but I'll confirm tomorrow morning. Otherwise, just close the door, no worries! :)

  Abby loved it here, she really enjoyed it.

  We leave a small “thank you” for all your good help with the car tyres.

[HOST] (2025-08-13T09:29:17.000Z)
  Hello, 
  
  If you're still at the lodge, I'll stop by at noon to say goodbye! 😊

  Hi Thomas! We are visiting the Lodge next week and I was wondering (because of the nice weather) how warm it gets inside
  and if there is an air conditioning or fan? I'd love to hear from you, thanks! Gr Tim and Lieke

[HOST] (2025-07-31T09:15:14.000Z)
  Hello Lieke and Tim 😌
  The lodge is very well insulated, and we do provide a fan. We are very well protected by the trees and the forest as
  well, so the temperature usually don’t rise too much ☺️
  
  Small detail : you’ve reached out via a booking inquiry for a new different stay, I’m going to approve it to avoid
  impacting our Airbnb response rate, but you can just ignore it and it will expire after 24h 😌
  
  Looking very much forward meeting you next week and wishing you the best till then !

[GUEST] (2025-08-06T08:10:54.000Z)
  Dear Caroline, Thomas. Can you tell us if there are towels in the cottage? Regards

[GUEST] (2025-08-07T07:32:52.000Z)
  Hello, is there a place we can dump the trash or do we have to gather it for you when we leave?

[HOST] (2025-08-07T07:36:03.000Z)
  Hello Lieke ☺️
  
  When the small bins under the sink are full, you can put the bag under the terrace. That’s it ! We’ll take care of it
  for you 😊 
  
  Hope your first night went smoothly ☺️
  
  Don’t hesitate if you have any other questions !
  
  Wishing you a wonderful day !

  Hello Thomas,
  
  We booked your house starting tomorrow and I wanted to know how the check-in works. Is there a code or should we let you
  know our approximate arrival time?
  
  Kind regards,

  If you warn us in advance of when you think you’ll arrive, we’ll try to be there to welcome you in person 😌
  
  Have a safe trip tomorrow !

  We just arrived at your beautiful place, wow what a view!

  Hey Heidi! So glad to read that ☺️
  As you can see, we didn’t steal the name 😁
  If you have any questions or need anything, you know where to find us 😌
  
  Have a wonderful first night at The View !
  
  ⏤ 🌳🌳 Thomas & Caroline

[GUEST] (2025-08-06T06:57:01.000Z)
  Hi Thomas, this is Anton, Heidi’s husband. 
  We’re checking out this morning, we had a fantastic stay and we will definitely be back. 
  
  Yesterday we had an issue with the hot tub where it suddenly gave an error code and stopped working.  I pulled out the
  plug, put it back in, the display of the remote is back on, but pump and heater are not functioning. I just left it as
  it is, didn’t touch any buttons. It was not a big deal for us, but just wanted to let you know..
  
  If you want me to follow specific steps to put it back on (maybe for other guests?) we’re still here till 10:30-11:00,
  otherwise I’ll just leave it as it is.

[HOST] (2025-08-06T07:19:41.000Z)
  Hello Anton!
  
  So sorry to read about that ! Glad it didn’t had too much of an impact for you. We’ll have this checkout, don’t worry
  about it at all ☺️
  
  As a little thank you for your stay, here’s a small gift from us: the code FRIENDSOFTHEVIEW gives you 15% off if you
  ever want to book directly through our website. No time limit, no usage limit — so feel free to use it for yourselves,
  or pass it on to friends 🌿
  
  If you have a minute, it would help us a lot if you could leave a 5-star review on Airbnb and on Google Maps (just
  search “The View Lodge Stoumont”) — it makes a real difference for a young place like ours.
  
  Enjoy your last morning with us ☺️
  
  See you soon again at The View !

  Hi Thomas,
  We are Fay (4) and Amy (28).
  We want to spend 2 days in Plopsa coo. Is it true that your beautiful cottage is not too far from here today?
  
  And I was wondering, an extra day of booking is unfortunately not possible, right?
  
  I'll hear from you!
  
  Best,
  Amy

[HOST] (2025-07-27T17:15:23.000Z)
  Hello Fay and Amy! 😌 We would be thrilled to welcome you at The View 😊 According to Google Maps it's exactly a 12-min
  ride to Plopsa from the lodge! You can try it yourself by selecting "The View Lodge" in Apple Maps or Google Maps as
  your origin, you'll get our exact location ! Indeed we have someone booked on 6/08 already sadly — but I might ask my
  cleaning team to come earlier so you could start your stay on the 3/08, would that be of interest to you? 😊 Wishing you
  both a lovely evening ! 🌳🌳 Thomas & Caroline

  Hi Thomas & Caroline, the view is beautiful. Thanks for the Champagne 🙂. Perhaps you have some recommendations around
  the Lodge, which we can reach by food?

[HOST] (2025-07-25T13:33:32.000Z)
  So glad to read that ☺️
  Do you mean recommendation for food by foot? 😁
  
  No restaurant at walking distance sadly, but we can recommend “Les Doux Ragots” at La Gleize, it’s a 5-10min car ride 😊
  
  Otherwise there is a ton of nice options in Spa (15min car trip) : Linea (our favorite), la Bobbeline, l’Olivier,… 😊

[HOST] (2025-07-25T13:42:15.000Z)

  Good morning,
  
  sorry for the late reply. I didn‘t read your message. Today at 6 pm would be suitable. 
  
  To get back to your question, I wanted to asked what can do on foot from the lodge 😄?
  
  Greetings
  Timo

[HOST] (2025-07-26T08:01:23.000Z)
  Hello,
  
  No worries ! Perfect for today 😌
  
  You have a tons of walks and trails around the Lodge. There is a small one starting right from the parking spot, you can
  go up for about 10-15min and you’ll get to a very nice view point.
  
  I can also suggest installing the app “AllTrails” that features detailed paths and trails 😌
  
  Have a nice day,

  Good morning, we have no hot water anymore in the house. Could you please check this?

[HOST] (2025-07-27T08:03:03.000Z)
  Good morning Timo! 
  
  Thank you for letting us know.
  
  The hot water system  uses a 120L tank powered by an ecological heat pump. This means that once the tank is empty, it
  can take a few hours to fully reheat — especially if a bath or long shower was recently taken.
  
  Would it be possible that all the hot water was recently used ? That would help us better understand the situation.
  
  In any case, the system should gradually recover. Please do keep us posted later today if the issue persists — we’re
  here to help.
  
  Warm regards,
  Thomas & Caroline
  The View Lodge

[HOST] (2025-07-27T09:16:16.000Z)
  Hello Timo, It's me again ! 😁 Just to let you know, I've tweaked a bit the settings of the heat pump : you should no
  longer run out of hot water anymore 😊 Should it happen never the less, please let me know so I can check what's
  happening 😌 Have a wonderful day!

[GUEST] (2025-07-27T09:19:59.000Z)
  Yes we had no hot water since yesterday morning. I forgot to write you. But we will see you the settings works 😉

[GUEST] (2025-07-27T09:20:05.000Z)
  Thanks

[HOST] (2025-07-27T09:25:09.000Z)
  Oh! In that case it's definitely not normal... I'm keeping an eye on it and I'll ping you as soon as hot water is back!
  Sorry about that, we're still fine tuning a few things as you can see ! 😌

[HOST] (2025-07-27T10:31:29.000Z)
  According to what I see in the smart home system, hot water is available again 😌 Sorry again for the inconvenience, if
  it happens again feel free to warn us immediately ☺️Have a nice day!

  Good evening Thimo !
  
  Tomorrow is the d-day already ! We can’t wait to welcome you at The View 😌
  
  I have great news : we don’t have any checkout tomorrow, so you can checkin whenever you want as early at 14:00 😌
  
  Do you know already when you should arrive ? We would love to welcome you in person and show you around ☺️
  
  Looking forward meeting you,

[GUEST] (2025-07-20T20:44:59.000Z)
  Goedenavond. 
  Wat super leuk dat je ons persoonlijk wilt ontvangen wij hebben daarvoor een activiteit. We weten niet precies tot
  hoelaat dat duurt maar gok dat we er tussen 2 en half 3 bij het huisje zijn.

[HOST] (2025-07-21T10:26:37.000Z)
  Hello Thimo,
  Unfortunately, when performing the last checks this morning we found out the outdoor Jaccuzi broke down this night 😱
  
  My partner Caroline rushed to the store to buy a new one and is in the process of emptying the old one and replacing it.
  The new one should be installed by 4pm, and hot probably tomorrow morning at the latest.
  
  Due to this unexpected incident, would it be possible for you to wait for 4pm to checkin ? You can off course drop your
  luggage’s before that if need be 😊 
  
  Sorry about that, looking very much to meet you ☺️

[GUEST] (2025-07-21T10:40:05.000Z)
  Wat verveld kan jij ook niks aan doen. Voor ons is 16:00 geen probleem. Dan zijn wij rond die tijd bij het huisje.

[HOST] (2025-07-21T10:46:50.000Z)

  Heyy,
  
  We’ve already left—we wanted to do a little city trip, so feel free to make yourself at home.
  We just wanted to thank you so much for the lovely stay. Even though things may not have gone exactly as you hoped, we
  had an amazing time and everything got sorted out, which is what matters most to us.
  
  Just a few small points we came across that might be helpful for you to know:
  	•	The lamp above the bed flickers quite a bit when it’s set to a low setting.
  	•	We suddenly didn’t have any hot water last night, but it was back again in the morning. This affected all the taps.
  Last night was the only time it happened.
  	•	The outdoor shower is amazing, but if you don’t have slippers—like my girlfriend—the stones can be a bit painful.
  Since it’s such a great spot to shower, maybe it’s an idea to put something down that’s more comfortable to stand on.
  	•	When you’re in the bathtub, the shower head hangs a bit awkwardly in the way.
  
  None of this took away from our experience at all, but we figured it might be helpful feedback for you.
  
  Also: we just ran the dishwasher with our things in it.
  
  Thanks again for the great days—we really enjoyed the peace and quiet, and you’ve arranged everything so well.
  
  Definitely a place we’d love to return to in the future!
  
  (We had some ice cream left in the freezer—we can’t really take it with us as it won’t survive the trip back. So feel
  free to have it if you’d like, otherwise feel free to toss it.)

[HOST] (2025-07-24T09:36:58.000Z)
  Hey hey ☺️
  
  Thank you so much for the kind message — it really means a lot to us! We’re so glad to hear you had a great time, even
  with the few little hiccups. Knowing everything got sorted and that you still enjoyed the peace and quiet makes us
  really happy.
  
  And thank you as well for the helpful feedback — that’s super valuable. We’ll definitely look into the lamp and the hot
  water issue to make sure it doesn’t happen again, and the ideas about the outdoor shower and the bath setup are spot on.
  We really appreciate you taking the time to share all that 🙏
  
  Also, thanks for running the dishwasher — much appreciated! And noted for the ice cream 😄
  
  As a little thank you for your stay, here’s a small gift from us: the code FRIENDSOFTHEVIEW gives you 15% off if you
  ever want to book directly through our website. No time limit, no usage limit — so feel free to use it for yourselves,
  or pass it on to friends 🌿
  
  If you have a minute, it would help us a lot if you could leave a 5-star review on Airbnb and on Google Maps (just
  search “The View Lodge Stoumont”) — it makes a real difference for a young place like ours.
  
  And if you’re curious to see what’s next, feel free to follow us on Instagram @theviewlodge.be ☺️
  
  Thanks again for everything — and you’re always welcome back at The View 🍃✨
  
  — Caroline & Thomas

  Hello, 
  Sorry to bother you. I would have liked to know if you offer long-term rentals for your accommodation. 
  Thank you and have a good day. 
  Johanna Gillet

[HOST] (2025-07-22T14:42:25.000Z)
  Hello Johanna,
  You don’t bother us, we are here to respond to any question you might have 😌
  We do have a 20% discount of stays of 7+ nights, you’ll see it calculated directly by AirBnB 😊 
  For longer stays or higher discounts, we suggest you reach out to us directly on other channels (Search for The View
  Lodge Stoumon). What dates do you have in mind? 😊 
  
  Looking forward welcoming you in our little forest paradise ! 🌳 🌳 🌳

[GUEST] (2025-07-22T14:48:21.000Z)
  Thank you very much for your friendly feedback ☺️
  
  Here is my situation and my request in a few words. 
  
  I am currently in transition: I was living with my ex-partner and we have just separated. I therefore have to leave the
  accommodation, even if I am not in an immediate emergency. As the atmosphere is no longer ideal, I am looking for a
  temporary place to stay, while I find a permanent home that suits me.
  
  Rather than rushing into a rental with a classic lease (and the notice constraints), I find the option of a monthly
  rental Airbnb much more suited to my current situation.
  
  I like your property very much, both for its aesthetics and for its location. I currently live in Gomzé-Andoumont, in a
  small cul-de-sac village surrounded by woods, and I am looking for a similar environment: very quiet, isolated, close to
  nature. This is an essential criterion for me, as I am rather introverted.
  
  I wanted to know if this type of long-term rental would suit you and under what conditions/price it could be done.
  I am of course available if you have any additional questions.

[HOST] (2025-07-22T14:58:37.000Z)
  Thank you for taking the time to explain your situation! We truly appreciate you considering The View for this new
  chapter — and we completely understand the need for calm and nature during a period of transition. We wish you the best
  of luck for that.
  
  That said, due to the high operational costs of our wellness amenities (like the sauna, jacuzzi, and smart automation),
  we unfortunately can’t go beyond the 20% (or maximum 25%) discount already proposed for longer stays. Anything lower
  wouldn’t be financially viable for us, even if we’d love to help.
  
  We realize this might not make The View the most practical option for your situation, and we totally understand if you
  decide to look elsewhere. There are many other lovely cabins and gîtes in the Ardennes that might be more suitable for a
  quiet, nature-focused long-term stay — and probably at a more affordable rate.
  
  We sincerely wish you strength and serenity in this transition. And if at any point you feel like taking a wellness
  break to reset, The View will be here for you 😌😌

[GUEST] (2025-07-22T15:48:20.000Z)
  Indeed, I was a little worried about the budget and I fully understand, it's a superb property you have there. 
  But unfortunately, I can't exceed €1,000/month right now for a rental. 
  
  Thank you so much for taking the time to read my request and give me feedback. 
  
  Have a good day

[HOST] (2025-07-22T18:08:22.000Z)
  Wishing you the best of luck Johanna 😌

[GUEST] (2025-07-22T18:29:03.000Z)
  Thank you very much and have a good evening ☺️

  Bonjour Julie,
  
  J’espère que votre séjour s’est bien passé ☺️☺️
  
  Comme vous le savez, vous étiez notre toute première resa!! 🥹
  
  Si vous avez la moindre remarques ou chose à améliorer, je suis à votre écoute ! 
  
  Et cela nous aiderait donc beaucoup, comme on débute,  si vous pouviez nous laisser une avis  sur AirBnb, ou sur Google
  Maps (“The View Lodge”). Vous pouvez aussi nous suivre sur Instagram (@theviewlodge.be) pour ne pas manquer notre
  actualité ☺️
  
  Enfin, nous voulions vous faire un petit cadeau tout spécial pour vous remercier de votre venue : le code
  “FRIENDSOFTHEVIEW” vous permet de réserver avec 15% de réduction via notre ssite. Il est valable sans limite de temps ou
  d’usage, donc si le séjour vous a plus n’hésitez pas à le partager autour de vous ☺️
  
  À très bientôt, bon retour à vous et à votre maman, et merci pour votre visite dans notre petit paradis ☺️☺️
  
  — Thomas & Caroline

[GUEST] (2025-07-19T16:03:15.000Z)
  Merci à vous 2 pour ce joli geste nous ne manquerons pas de vous recommander et si l'occasion se représente nous
  reviendrons à nouveau 😊

[GUEST] (2025-07-19T16:03:25.000Z)
  Bonne continuation

[GUEST] (2025-07-19T16:03:32.000Z)
  🤗🤗🤗

[HOST] (2025-07-19T16:11:50.000Z)
  Bonjour Julie,
  
  Un tout grand merci pour votre magnifique retour, ça nous touche énormément et ça nous encourage beaucoup 🥹🙏
  
  J’ai juste une toute petite demande à vous faire… Vous avez pris le temps de partager quelques suggestions
  d’amélioration (moustiquaires, ventilation, etc.) et on les prend vraiment à cœur — on va d’ailleurs y travailler dans
  les semaines à venir !
  
  Mais comme on démarre tout juste, chaque avis compte énormément pour nous et, sur une plateforme comme AirBnb, même des
  remarques très légitimes peuvent malheureusement freiner certaines personnes à réserver 😔
  
  Si jamais vous êtes d’accord, est-ce que ce serait possible de retirer la partie avec les “petits points constructifs”
  du commentaire public ? Cela nous aiderait énormément dans notre aventure… 😕
  
  Encore un immense merci à vous deux pour votre confiance, et j’espère vraiment avoir le plaisir de vous recroiser un
  jour à The View 🌲
  
  Belle soirée, 
  Thomas

[GUEST] (2025-07-18T08:51:54.000Z)
  Dear Thomas, 
  I have come across your lovely cabin in search for a nice relaxing place over the new year holiday. We live in Gent
  center, and I was wondering if would be possible for our dog to join us? We look for a quiet escape to get away from the
  fireworks on New years eve, and enjoy nature and realxing. I see that there is no other cabins close by so it would be
  an ideal setting. Thank you for letting me know!
  Best,
  Katie

[HOST] (2025-07-18T08:55:41.000Z)
  Hello Katie,
  We would be thrilled to welcome you at The View! Sadly, to preserve the quality of the accommodations we don’t allow
  pets at the moment. Hope you understand 😌
  
  Wishing you a lovely day !

  ☺️

[GUEST] (2025-07-18T09:11:08.000Z)
  Thank you Thomas, but in this situation we won’t be able to this time.
